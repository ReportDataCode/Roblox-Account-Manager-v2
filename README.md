# Roblox Account Manager
Application that allows you to add multiple accounts into one application allowing you to easily play on alt accounts without having to change accounts

Useful for games that require grinding off other players, or storage accounts that hold in game items or currency, or just to have multiple accounts that you can easily find and use.

# DISCLAIMER
If someone asks you to generate an "rbx-player link", **DO NOT** do it, they can use these to join any game using your account, or even launch roblox studio with one of your games. They can do many things in game such as spend your robux or even do things that can get your account terminated. **USE THESE FEATURES AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Extra Features
Extra features can be enabled by adding a file called "dev.mode" to the same folder as the executable.
Beware of the risks that you are taking if you accidentally send something to someone.

If you ever want a friend to join a game using your account, make sure you have the PlaceId and JobId correctly entered, then right click an account, and click "Copy rbx-player link", DO NOT do this if someone asks you for it.
